## Understanding Learning Plateaus

A learning plateau occurs when a student's progress stalls despite continued practice. Early detection allows for timely interventions that can restart learning momentum.

## How We Detect Plateaus

### Three Primary Indicators

<ParamField name="Velocity Decline" required>
Consistent decrease in learning velocity over 7+ days
</ParamField>

<ParamField name="Mastery Stagnation" required>
Mastery probability fails to increase despite correct answers
</ParamField>

<ParamField name="Efficiency Drop" required>
Cognitive efficiency decreases while difficulty remains constant
</ParamField>

### Example Detection

```python
plateau_signals = {
    "velocity_declining": True,
    "velocity_days": 10,
    "mastery_stagnant": True,
    "mastery_attempts": 15,
    "efficiency_dropping": True,
    "efficiency_trend": -0.15,
    "plateau_confidence": "high"
}
```

## Automatic Detection

The engine automatically monitors for plateau conditions:

```python
from cognition_engine import CognitionEngine

engine = CognitionEngine(supabase_url, supabase_key)

# Track an answer
result = await engine.track_answer(
    user_id="student_123",
    skill_id="algebra",
    is_correct=True,
    time_spent_seconds=60
)

if result['plateau_detected']:
    print("⚠️ Plateau detected!")
    print(f"Confidence: {result['plateau_confidence']}")
    print(f"Recommendation: {result['recommendation']}")
```

## Intervention Strategies

### Plateau Severity Levels

<Warning type="warning">
**Mild Plateau**: Slight velocity decrease, may self-correct
</Warning>

<Warning type="error">
**Moderate Plateau**: Clear stagnation, intervention recommended
</Warning>

<Warning type="danger">
**Severe Plateau**: Declining performance, urgent intervention needed
</Warning>

### Recommended Interventions

#### 1. Difficulty Adjustment

```python
intervention = {
    "type": "difficulty_adjustment",
    "current_difficulty": "medium",
    "recommended_difficulty": "easy",
    "reasoning": "Return to fundamentals to rebuild confidence"
}
```

#### 2. Topic Change

```python
intervention = {
    "type": "topic_switch",
    "current_skill": "trigonometry",
    "recommended_skill": "algebra",
    "reasoning": "Switch to a different area to maintain engagement"
}
```

#### 3. Practice Frequency

```python
intervention = {
    "type": "frequency_change",
    "current_sessions": 3,
    "recommended_sessions": 5,
    "reasoning": "Increase practice to break through plateau"
}
```

#### 4. Learning Mode

```python
intervention = {
    "type": "learning_mode",
    "current_mode": "practice",
    "recommended_mode": "review",
    "reasoning": "Emphasize review and reinforcement over new problems"
}
```

## Manual Plateau Check

Check for plateaus programmatically:

```python
plateau_status = await engine.check_plateau_status("student_123", "algebra")

if plateau_status['is_plateauing']:
    print(f"Plateau since: {plateau_status['started_date']}")
    print(f"Current severity: {plateau_status['severity']}")
    print(f"Interventions: {plateau_status['recommendations']}")
```

## Prevention Strategies

### Early Warning Signals

Monitor these metrics to catch plateaus before they fully develop:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Velocity Slowdown">
    Learning velocity begins to decrease even slightly. First warning sign.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mastery Resistance">
    Correct answers fail to increase mastery probability as expected. Core indicator.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Increased Time">
    Students taking longer on similar problems. Cognitive load increasing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Confidence Drop">
    Lower confidence scores despite same difficulty level. Uncertainty growing.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Real-World Example

### Student Story

```python
# Week 1-2: Strong progress
{
    "velocity": 0.035,
    "efficiency": 0.82,
    "mastery": 0.65
}

# Week 3: Early warning
{
    "velocity": 0.022,      # Declining
    "efficiency": 0.75,     # Dropping
    "mastery": 0.68         # Slow growth
}

# Week 4: Plateau confirmed
{
    "velocity": 0.01,       # Minimal progress
    "efficiency": 0.68,     # Below threshold
    "mastery": 0.68,        # Stagnant
    "plateau_detected": True
}

# Intervention: Switch topics
# Result: Recovery and continued progress
{
    "velocity": 0.030,
    "efficiency": 0.80,
    "mastery": 0.72
}
```

## Dashboard Integration

Create plateau monitoring dashboards:

```python
async def get_student_plateau_report(user_id):
    skills = await get_all_skills(user_id)
    
    plateau_report = []
    for skill in skills:
        status = await engine.check_plateau_status(user_id, skill.id)
        if status['is_plateauing']:
            plateau_report.append({
                "skill": skill.name,
                "severity": status['severity'],
                "recommendation": status['recommendations'][0]
            })
    
    return plateau_report
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Review plateau status weekly. Early intervention prevents longer stalls.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Don't overreact to single day performance drops. Look for trends over 5+ days.
</Warning>

<Info>
Plateaus are normal in learning. The key is rapid detection and appropriate intervention.
</Info>

### Intervention Timing

- **Day 5-7**: Monitor closely, gather data
- **Day 8-10**: Mild intervention (encouragement, hints)
- **Day 11+**: Active intervention (difficulty adjustment, topic switch)

## Measuring Intervention Effectiveness

Track recovery after intervention:

```python
recovery_metrics = {
    "pre_intervention_velocity": 0.01,
    "post_intervention_velocity": 0.025,
    "recovery_days": 3,
    "effectiveness": "good"
}
```
