## What is Learning Velocity?

Learning velocity measures the **rate of improvement** in student mastery over time. Unlike simple progress tracking, velocity reveals whether students are accelerating, maintaining steady progress, or approaching plateaus.

## Key Metrics

<ParamField name="Overall Velocity" required>
Average change in mastery across all skills over time
</ParamField>

<ParamField name="Skill Velocity" required>
Velocity for individual skills or topics
</ParamField>

<ParamField name="Velocity Trend" required>
Whether velocity is increasing, decreasing, or stable
</ParamField>

<ParamField name="Momentum Score" required>
Composite score (0-100) combining velocity, consistency, and activity level
</ParamField>

## Understanding Momentum Score

The momentum score is calculated from multiple factors:

```python
{
    "momentum_score": 85,           # 0-100 composite score
    "velocity_trend": "accelerating", # accelerating, stable, declining
    "consistency": 0.92,             # How consistent performance is
    "activity_level": 0.88,          # Recent practice frequency
    "cognitive_efficiency": 0.75     # Time-effectiveness ratio
}
```

<Info>
Momentum scores above 70 indicate strong progress. Scores below 40 suggest intervention may be needed.
</Info>

## Velocity Analysis

### Example Usage

```python
from cognition_engine import CognitionEngine

engine = CognitionEngine(supabase_url, supabase_key)

# Get velocity analytics
velocity = await engine.get_learning_velocity("student_123")

print(f"Momentum: {velocity['momentum_score']}/100")
print(f"Trend: {velocity['velocity_trend']}")
print(f"Consistency: {velocity['consistency']:.2f}")
```

### Velocity Trend Interpretation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Accelerating">
    Velocity is increasing. The student is learning faster over time. This often indicates growing confidence and efficiency.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Stable">
    Velocity remains consistent. Steady progress without signs of plateau. This is typically healthy learning.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Declining">
    Velocity is decreasing. May indicate upcoming plateau or burnout. Consider intervention or difficulty adjustment.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Optimizing Study Schedules

### High Momentum

When momentum is high (70+), students can:

- **Increase difficulty** - Challenge with harder problems
- **Cover more topics** - Introduce new skills efficiently
- **Reduce frequency** - Maintain retention with spaced practice

### Low Momentum

When momentum is low (<40), consider:

- **Review fundamentals** - Strengthen foundation skills
- **Reduce difficulty** - Build confidence with easier problems
- **Increase frequency** - More practice to build proficiency

## Real-World Example

```python
# Student profile
velocity_data = {
    "momentum_score": 68,
    "velocity_trend": "stable",
    "overall_velocity": 0.023,
    "skill_velocities": {
        "algebra": 0.035,    # Strong progress
        "geometry": 0.015,   # Moderate progress
        "trigonometry": -0.01 # Declining - needs attention
    }
}

# Personalized recommendation
if velocity_data['skill_velocities']['trigonometry'] < 0:
    print("Recommended: Focus on trigonometry fundamentals")
    print("Difficulty adjustment: Lower current level")
    print("Frequency: Increase practice sessions")
```

## Integration with Predictions

Velocity data powers predictive analytics:

```python
# Velocity influences score predictions
predictions = await engine.get_predictions("student_123")

print(f"30-day prediction: {predictions['predicted_total_in_30_days']}")
print(f"Velocity contribution: {predictions['velocity_boost']}")
print(f"Days to goal: {predictions['days_to_goal']}")
```

<Warning>
Low or negative velocity for extended periods can significantly impact future score predictions and goal achievement timelines.
</Warning>

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Dimensional Velocity

Track velocity across different dimensions:

- **By skill**: Individual topic velocity
- **By difficulty**: Easy vs. hard problem velocity
- **By time of day**: Morning vs. evening performance
- **By session type**: Practice vs. test velocity

### Acceleration Tracking

Monitor whether velocity itself is changing:

```python
"acceleration": {
    "value": 0.002,           # Positive = speeding up
    "trend": "increasing",    # Direction of acceleration change
    "significance": "high"    # Statistical confidence
}
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Review velocity trends weekly for early plateau detection. Declining trends caught early are easier to address.
</Tip>

<Info>
Combine velocity analysis with cognitive efficiency metrics for comprehensive learning optimization.
</Info>

<Warning>
Don't overreact to single-day velocity changes. Focus on trends over 5-7 day periods.
</Warning>
