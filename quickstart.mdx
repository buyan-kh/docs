## Introduction

The Cognitive Learning Engine provides unprecedented insights into learning patterns by tracking not just what students know, but **how they learn**. This quickstart guide will help you integrate cognitive intelligence into your platform.

## Installation

### Using Python SDK

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install cognition-engine-sdk
```

```bash npm
npm install cognition-engine
```
</CodeGroup>

## Basic Usage

### Step 1: Initialize the Engine

```python
from cognition_engine import CognitionEngine

# Initialize the engine
engine = CognitionEngine(
    supabase_url="your-supabase-url",
    supabase_key="your-supabase-key"
)
```

### Step 2: Track Learning Events

Every time a student answers a question, track it with the engine:

```python
# Track a learning event
result = await engine.track_answer(
    user_id="student_123",
    skill_id="algebra_001",
    is_correct=True,
    time_spent_seconds=45,
    confidence_score=4
)

print(f"New mastery: {result['mastery_after']}")
print(f"Learning velocity: {result['velocity']}")
```

### Step 3: Get Predictive Insights

```python
# Get predictive analytics
predictions = await engine.get_predictions("student_123")
print(f"Predicted SAT in 30 days: {predictions['predicted_total_in_30_days']}")

# Analyze learning patterns
velocity = await engine.get_learning_velocity("student_123")
print(f"Momentum score: {velocity['momentum_score']}")
```
